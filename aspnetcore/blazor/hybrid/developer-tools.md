This article explains how to use [browser developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Developer_Tools) with Blazor Hybrid apps.

## Emulator console window 

Access the developer tools console to read exception messages. In the following example, the **Console** tab of developer tools during emulation of an Apple tablet device shows an unhandled exception in a .NET MAUI Blazor app:

## iOS

Follow these steps to inspect console messages of an iOS app in desktop Safari, including exception messages:

1. Open desktop Safari.
1. Select the **Preferences** > **Advanced** > **Show Develop** menu item.
1. Run the .NET MAUI Blazor app in the Visual Studio emulator.
1. Return to desktop Safari. Select **Develop** > **Simulator** > **0.0.0.0**. If multiple entries for **0.0.0.0** are present, select the entry that highlights the `WebView`. The `WebView` is highlighted in blue in the Visual Studio emulator when the correct **0.0.0.0** entry is selected.
1. The **Web Inspector** appears for the `WebView`.

## Android

Follow these steps to inspect console messages of an Android app in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, including exception messages:

1. Start the Visual Studio Android emulator and navigate to the .NET MAUI Blazor app `WebView`.
1. Open Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
1. Navigate to `chrome://inspect/#devices` (Google Chrome) or `edge://inspect/#devices` (Microsoft Edge).
1. Select the **`inspect`** link button to open developer tools:
